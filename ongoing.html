                        <h2>Game: Bing Bing's Adventure</h2>
                        <h4>Why?</h4> 
                        I started this project as a way to explore further in to the utility of <a href="https://pyga.me/" target="_blank">pygame ce</a> and to practice my programming, music making and art capabilities
                        <h4><br>Description</h4>
                        The world has become incredibly unstable over the few years, which could destroy the world. Bing Bing has set of on an adventure to find out what is causing all the destruction but he has to get back before tea time.

                        <h2>Youtube</h2>
                        <h4>Why?</h4> 
                        I started this project as a way to develope my Video Editing capabilities, try to make this as another income source and see what I can make for mself and the community
                        <h4><br>Persona</h4>
                        I go under the name "Blackout" as the death screen in League Of Legends is a black and white screen, and I thought it was cool and funny.
                        <h4><br>Content</h4>
                        Mostly edited clips from my games from League Of Legends edited together with Meme Sound Effects
