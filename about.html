                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        Hi, I am Yi Jie, a pround alumni of Montfort Military Band and its ex-Band Major
                        <h4><br>Birthday</h4>
                        I will be 18 years old this 21 January 2023
                        <h4><br>Current Education</h4>
                        I am currently studying and am part of the Nanyang Polytechinic Symphonic Orchestra (Did not pursue Exco position to focus on my Academics)

                        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                        <h4>Fair Price</h4>
                        I used to work at Fair Price in Ang Mo Kio Hub for 4 months before entering Polytechinic. I was assign the fruits section and would help to restock the items. Sometimes I would also help in the vegetable section as well. It was the first time I had ever worked and it was  hell, especially during the Chinese New Year Times where it was crowded and we had to handle the Oranges. Overall I came out with an even bigger respect for these workers and what they do as well as knowledge of how this buisiness works.
                        <h4><br>Usherer: Young Living Essensial Oils</h4>
                        I worked with this company during tehe First Year break of Polytechinic. I worked with them for four days. It was quite tough as there was a very big crowd of people from different countries in South East Asia and was hard to manage. Fortunately, I had very nice co-workers and bosses who took care of me and the other temperory workers like getting us drinks. Overall, I learn how to manage crowds and some nice quotes from the event.

                        I have four years of Python Coding experience, two years of HTML, CSS and Javascript experience and one year of C++ and C# coding experience.
                        <h4><br>Strength 1. Perserverance</h4>
                        No matter how big the challenge is, I will do my best to push through and accomplish my goals. And when I fail, I will pick myself up again, understand what went wrong, learn from it and continue onto the next challange.

                        <h4><br>Strength 2. Supportive</h4>
                        I will do my best to support anyone that needs any form of help and support, so long it is within my abilities.

                        <h4><br>Strength 3. Time Planning</h4>
                        I can manage my time well by first, setting priorities based on urgency and need, and then plan out the time it needs to complete certain task on certain days
