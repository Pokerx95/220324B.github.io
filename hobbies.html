                        <h2>Playing The Trumpet</h2>
                        <h4>How I Became Interested?</h4> 
                        Back when I was in Kindergarden, my brother was in the band and was playing all kinds of cool music which also inspired me to join the Symphony Band in my Primary School.

                        <h4><br>Why I enjoy it?</h4>
                        I really like the pieces that we play and the people in the band CCA that I was a part of so far are really nice which is a nice encouragement to make me continue this hobby.

                        <h4>How I Became Interested?</h4> 
                        When I first joined the computer science class in Secondary 3, we were using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language. I was really interested in 2d Platformer games at that time and wanted to create my own. So I followed a few online tutorials a fell in love with Game Development.

                        I like Platformer Games and wanted to create a game that could inspire other people to start their own game developing journey.

                        <h4>How I Became Interested?</h4> 
                        It came from playing the trumpet and it encouraged me to start creating my own music using an online music maker: <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/#9n31s6k0l00e03t2ma7g0fj07r1i0o432T6v1u75f10n9q802d03W7E129T1v1ueaf12taq0y10r53d18A8F8B8Q126bPda58E4b862863g78T5v1ua0f60m92hc1ea2k02f30req83431d37H_QiBy9asq99900h0E0T2v1u15f10w4qw02d03w0E0b4h400000000h4g000000014h000000004h400000000p16000000" target="_blank">Beep Box</a>

                        Like making games, I also want to create inspirational music that can not only encourage people to create their own music, but also to "feel" the music.

                        When I was younger and bored, I would always look up at the sky. When I was lucky that there were no clouds, I could see the beautiful stars in the night sky and I fell in love with it
